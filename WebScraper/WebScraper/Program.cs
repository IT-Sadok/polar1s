/* TODO
1) Reads a list of URLs from a file. (practice I/O from files and async)
2) Scrapes content from each URL asynchronously. (practice concurrency and error handling)
3) Processes the scraped content to gather text statistics (line count, word count, word frequency) (practice LINQ and working with strings).
4) Uses a producer-consumer pattern to manage the scraping and processing concurrently. (practice concurrency)
